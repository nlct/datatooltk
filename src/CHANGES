v2.0 (pending)

 - Split into three applications: basic DatatoolTk (batch and GUI
   and TeX, CSV/TSV, ODS, XLSX and SQL import options),
   DatatoolTk Extra (as basic but with extra XLS import option),
   and DatatoolTk Restricted (batch only, no SQL import option).

 - Added support for new datatool.sty v3.0 database construction commands.

 - Added support for new datatool.sty v3.0 datum format (which
   allows both a formatted number and the actual plain number to be
   stored together, to avoid repeated parsing and re-formatting).

 - Added support for sorting by multiple columns (where equal values
   are compared, try the next column in the list) and providing 
   fallback columns (where a value needed for comparison is missing,
   use the value provided by the fallback column).

 - Dropped some third party libraries.

 - Reimplemented parsing for ODS and added support for XLSX.
   (This only searches for applicable XML content rather than
    parsing everything.)

 - Replaced the help system used in GUI mode.

 - (GUI mode) replaced multiple import menu items with single import
   dialog; (batch mode) added multi-purpose `--import` switch which
   probes file to determine the likely file type (if the probe is
   incorrect, you will need to use the applicable older switch, for
   example `--csv` or `--probsoln`).

 - (Batch mode) added `--tsv` to identify tab-separated files (since
   it can be difficult to include a tab character in the command
   line).
